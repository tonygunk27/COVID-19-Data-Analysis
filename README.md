# COVID-19-Data-Analysis

There are two datasets used in this project (the ‘Corona Dataset’, published by Johns Hopkins University). The first dataset consists of data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each country. The second one contains various life factors, such as GDP per capita, happiness index, et cetera, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. With the help of Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, seaborn and matplotlib, the two datasets are processed and visualized to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are living in that country.
